# Homework 3 - Places of the world

The purpose of this repository is to answer the assigned questions in the [Homework 3](https://github.com/lucamaiano/ADM/tree/master/2022/Homework_3) of the Algorithms for Data Mining course, 2022.

The data collection is performed on the [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com) website. The repository consists of the following files:

1. `general.ipynb`: a Jupyter Notebook that answers the questions: 
- Data collection
- Search Engine
- Define a new score!
- Visualizing the most relevant places
- BONUS: More complex search engine
- Theoretical question
2. `CommandLine.sh`: The code used to provide the answers to the Commmand Line questions
3. `html_page`: The folder that contains the html files of each page, it is composed of 400 subfolders, each folder has 18 html files.
4. `tsv_files`: The Tsv files of each place.
5. `places_lists.txt`: The text file containing the urls of the places.
6. `places.tsv`: The tsv file that contains the data that we have collected.
7. `ApplicantsInfo.txt`: The students' information txt file given by the professor.
8. `inverted_index.pkl`:
9. `inverted_index_tfidf.pkl`:
10. `vocabulary.pkl`:
11. `RankingList.txt`: The text file resulted from solving the theoretical question using the first algorithm.
12. `RankingList2.txt`: The text file resulted from solving the theoretical question using the second algorithm.
13. `RankingList3.txt`: The text file resulted from solving the theoretical question using the third algorithm.
14. `RankingList4.txt`: The text file resulted from solving the theoretical question using the mapreduce algorithm.
